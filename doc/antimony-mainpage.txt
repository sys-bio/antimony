/** @mainpage Antimony: A modular human-readable, human-writeable model definition language

<P>Antimony is a text-based model definition language based on <A HREF="http://www.sys-bio.org/software/jarnac.htm">Jarnac</a>, and extended to be fully modular.  Antimony models can be converted to and from SBML, flattening the modularity in the process.  See also: @subpage antimony-why </P>
