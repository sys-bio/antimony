<h3><a id="intro">Introduction: the basics</a></h3>

Creating a model in Antimony is designed to be very straightforward and simple.  Model elements are created and defined in text, with a simple syntax.

The most common way to use Antimony is to create a reaction network, where processes are defined wherein some elements are consumed and other elements are created.  Using the language of SBML, the processes are called 'reactions' and the elements are called 'species', but any set of processes and elements may be modeled in this way.  The syntax for defining a reaction in Antimony is to list the species being consumed, separated by a '<code>+</code>', followed by an arrow ('<code>-></code>'), followed by another list of species being created, followed by a semicolon.  If this reaction has a defined mathematical rate at which this happens, that rate can be listed next:

<pre>
  S1 -> S2; k1*S1
</pre>

The above model defines a reaction where '<code>S1</code>' is converted to '<code>S2</code>' at a rate of '<code>k1*S1</code>'.

This model cannot be simulated, however, because a simulator would not know what the conditions are to start the simulation.  These values can be set by using an equals sign:

<pre>
  S1 -> S2; k1*S1
  S1 = 10
  S2 = 0
  k1 = 0.1
</pre>

The above, then, is a complete model that can be simulated by any software that understands SBML (to which Antimony models can be converted).

If you want to give your model a name, you can do that by wrapping it with the text: '<code>model [name] [reactions, etc.] end</code>':

<pre>
model example1
  S1 -> S2; k1*S1
  S1 = 10
  S2 = 0
  k1 = 0.1
end
</pre>

In subsequent examples in this tutorial, we'll be using this syntax to name the examples, but for simple models, the name is optional.  Later, when we discuss submodels, this will become more important.

We can also name our reactions and add comments.  Here, we give the reaction the ID '<code>J0</code>', and add some comments, using the '<code>//</code>' and '<code>/* */</code>' syntax.

<pre>
/* This is the second example model
   in this tutorial */
model example2
  J0: S1 -> S2 + S3; k1*S1 //Mass-action kinetics
  S1 = 10  //The initial concentration of S1
  S2 = 0   //The initial concentratio of S2
  S3 = 3   //The initial concentratio of S3
  k1 = 0.1 //The value of the kinetic parameter from J0.
end
</pre>

The names of the reaction and the model are saved in SBML, but any comments are not.  The model fully translated to SBML can be found <A HREF="example2.xml">here</a>.

Some model contain species whose concentrations are not affected by the reactions in the model: these are commonly referred to as 'boundary species'.  In Antimony, you can designate a species as being a boundary species be prefixing it with a '<code>$</code>', or by declaring it to be '<code>const</code>' ('<code>const S1</code>').  This technique is used in the following model of an oscillator, which also uses multiple reactions and more complex reaction rates:

<pre>
model oscli
  //Reactions:
  J0: $X0 => S1; J0_v0;
  J1: S1 => $X1; J1_k3*S1;
  J2: S1 => S2; (J2_k1*S1 - J2_k_1*S2)*(1 + J2_c*S2^J2_q);
  J3: S2 => $X2; J3_k2*S2;

  // Species initializations:
  S1 = 0
  S2 = 1
  X0 = 1
  X1 = 0
  X2 = 0

  // Variable initializations:
  J0_v0 = 8
  J1_k3 = 0
  J2_k1 = 1
  J2_k_1 = 0
  J2_c = 1
  J2_q = 3
  J3_k2 = 5
end
</pre>


<h3><a id="rules">Assignment rules and rate rules</a></h3>

Thus far, we have only discussed quantities changing in time through participation in reactions.  It is also possible to define how something changes in time directly, either by declaring what formula a symbol will always equal at all points in time (what SBML calls an 'assignment rule') or by declaring what its derivative with respect to time is (what SBML calls a 'rate rule').
