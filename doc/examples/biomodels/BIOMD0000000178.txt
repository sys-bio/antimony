  // Compartments and Species:
  compartment extracellular, endosome, neuroplasm;
  species $BoNT in extracellular, bulk in extracellular, free in extracellular;

  // Assignment Rules:
  BoNT := bulk + free;
  tension := 1 - lytic;

  // Reactions:
  endocytosis: bound => translocate; endocytosis_kT*bound*extracellular;
