  // Compartments and Species:
  compartment geometry;
  species CDK2cycA in geometry, CyclinA in geometry, Cdk2 in geometry, CDK2cycA_star_ in geometry;

  // Assignment Rules:
  total_fluorescence := CDK2cycA * 599990 * 1.000000e+06 / 43200 + CDK2cycA_star_ * 599990 * 1.000000e+06 / 43200 + basal_fluorescence;

  // Reactions:
  Binding: Cdk2 + CyclinA -> CDK2cycA; Binding_kf * Cdk2 * CyclinA * geometry - Binding_kb * CDK2cycA * geometry;
  Activation: CDK2cycA -> CDK2cycA_star_; Activation_kf * CDK2cycA * geometry - Activation_kb * CDK2cycA_star_ * geometry;
