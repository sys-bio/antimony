// Warnings from automatic translation:
//    Unable to create port constraint__constraint0 in model CompModel because Constraint elements do not exist in Antimony, and are therefore untranslateable.
//    Unable to create port functionDefinition__f in model CompModel because function defintions are global in Antimony, not local.
//    Unable to process deletion from submodel C1 in model CompTest.  Deletions of FunctionDefinition elements have not been added as a concept in Antimony.
//    Unable to process deletion from submodel C1 in model CompTest.  Constraint elements cannot be expressed in Antimony at all.  (Deleting them is therefore safe, because they are automatically dropped anyway.)
//    Unable to create port compartment__Cell__C1 in model CompTest because the object the port referenced is in a submodel, and these objects cannot be declared ports in Antimony.
