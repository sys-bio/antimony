Thank you for using Antimony, a human-readable, human-writable modular model definition language.

The documentation for this project is in the doc/ subdirectory, and was created with Doxygen.  Described there is information about the Antimony model language and the libAntimony library, including compilation instructions.

To enable full functionality in libAntimony, you first need to install libSBML, available from http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML/.  Both libSBML and libAntimony now use CMake as their build systems.

For CellML:

The CellML API v1.10 SDK was used in this version of Antimony (and QTAntimony) and seems to work OK.  As of this writing, the URL to download the SDK was http://www.cellml.org/tools/downloads/cellml_api/releases/1.10
