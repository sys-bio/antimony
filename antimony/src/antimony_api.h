  * @brief   The API for the Antimony parser
  * @author  Lucian Smith
  *
  * libAntimony uses a bison parser, libSBML, and internal C++ objects to read, convert, store, and output abstracted models of biological systems.  Information about creating antimony-formatted input files is available from http://sys-bio.org/.  The functions described in this document are a plain C API (application programming interface) to be used in programs that want to convert Antimony models to their own internal formats, and/or to convert Antimony models to and from SBML models.
  *
  * Note:  It is not currently possible to convert an internally-formatted model into an Antimony model (the API has several 'get' functions, but no 'set' functions).  This restriction will be relaxed in future versions of the library.
  *
  * Antimony models are modular; that is, one model may be defined and then used as a subset of a larger model.  As such, a single Antimony file may contain a number of different models, each referred to as a 'module'.  SBML files are (as of January 2009) not modular, and only contain a single model per file.  When writing SBML files, therefore, only one module may be written per file.  (A proposed aspect of SBML Level 3 is to introduce modularity in a similar way to how Antimony works; once libSBML implements this modularity, libAntimony will be extended to allow writing and reading of modular SBML files as well.)
  *
  * Converting files may be accomplished fairly straightforwardly using 'loadFile' to read in a file (of either Antimony or SBML format), 'getNumModules' and 'getModuleNames' to obtain a list of the modules in that file, and finally the 'writeAntimonyFile' or 'writeSBMLFile' routines to write them out again.
  *
  * Converting the models inside Antimony or SBML files to your own internal format for your software is a bit more involved.  An example program is provided that will read in a list of files, write out all the included modules to individual Antimony and SBML files, and write out a list of the components to the screen in a few different formats which will hopefully prove useful as an example.  The 'printAllDataFor' routine in the file antimony_api.cpp may also be used as an example, as it only uses routines provided in the API, and is thus fully exportable and modifiable in other C or C++ programs.
  *
  * In general, Antimony models may contain:
  * - Species
  * - Reactions
  * - Reaction rates and other formulas
  * - Compartments
  * - Events
  * - Interactions (not modelled explicitly in SBML, only implied)
  * - DNA strands (not modelled explicitly in SBML)
  *
  * Note that there are many concepts modelled in SBML that are not modelled in libAntimony--as such, libAntimony is not the ideal tool to use to convert SBML models with those concepts included; the excellent libSBML (http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML) should be used instead.  Similarly, the concepts in Antimony not in SBML (the main ones being modularity, interactions, and DNA strands) will be lost when converting to an SBML file, so converting an Antimony file to SBML and back again may be lossy.
  *
  * Return Types
  * Many of the functions listed below ask for an enum value to determine what kind of symbol you are asking about.  This list is declared in enums.h, and is as follows:
  * - 0: allSymbols:        Every symbol of every type in Antimony
  * - 1: allSpecies:        All species, both const (border) and variable.
  * - 2: allFormulas:       All formulas (values defined by an equation), both const and variable.
  * - 3: allDNA:            All symbols defined to be DNA (operators and genes, but not strands).
  * - 4: allOperators:      All symbols defined to be operators (formulas embeddable in a DNA strand).
  * - 5: allGenes:          All symbols defined to be genes (reactions embeddable in a DNA strand).
  * - 6: allReactions:      All reactions (species being converted or created).
  * - 7: allInteractions:   All interactions (species involved in reaction rates).
  * - 8: allEvents:         All events.
  * - 9: allCompartments:   All compartments, both const and variable.
  * - 10: allUnknown:        All symbols whose type has never been defined or used.
  * - 11: varSpecies:        Variable species.
  * - 12: varFormulas:       Formulas (equations) that can change (including as a result of events).
  * - 13: varOperators:      Operators with variable values.
  * - 14: varCompartments:   Compartments with variable sizes.
  * - 15: constSpecies:      Constant species (aka 'border species').
  * - 16: constFormulas:     Formulas with constant values.
  * - 17: constOperators:    Operators with constant values.
  * - 18: constCompartments: Compartments with constant sizes.
  * - 19: subModules:        Submodules used within the current module.
  * - 20: expandedStrands:   DNA strands containing nothing but operators and genes--any sub-strands have been expanded to their component DNA objects, and those sub-strands are not included in any lists.
  * - 21: modularStrands:    All defined DNA strands, with some being subparts of the others.
  *
  * Returned Pointers
  * The majority of the functions described below return pointers to arrays and/or strings.  These pointers pointers you then own, created with 'malloc':  you must 'free' them yourself to release the allocated memory.  Some programming environments will handle this automatically for you, and others will not.  If you want to not bother with it, the function 'freeAll' is provided, which will free every pointer created by this library.  In order for this to work, however, you must have not freed a single provided pointer yourself, and you must not subsequently try to reference any data provided by the library (your own copies of the data will be fine, of course).
  *
  * If the library runs out of memory when trying to return a pointer, it will return NULL instead and attempt to set an error message, retrievable with 'getLastError()'.
