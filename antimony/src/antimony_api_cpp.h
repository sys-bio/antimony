  * @file    antimony_api_cpp.h
  * @brief   An API for the Antimony parser using C++ objects
  * @author  Lucian Smith
  *
  * When creating Python bindings for antimony_api.h, we ran into the problem that some return values were arrays, and did not contain information about their length, making them impossible to wrap in some languages.  This file therefore converts any function from the C API and converts it to use C++ vectors (and strings) instead.
