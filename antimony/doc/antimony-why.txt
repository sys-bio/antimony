/** @page antimony-why Features of the Antimony language

Antimony is designed to be:

- <b>Human-readable</b>.  It should be possible to look at an Antimony model and understand what's going on.
- <b>Human-writable</b>.  It should be possible to conceive of a model and create an Antimony model by hand.
- <b>Modular</b>.  Different Antimony models should be able to be combined to create more complex models that are easier to understand due to their compartmentalized nature.
- <b>Accessible to genetic networks</b>.  A special syntax was developed specifically for the design of genetic networks, in keeping with the principles above--these networks should also be understandable, modular, and easily combined.

Some other model definition languages do feature one or more of the above
characteristics, but Antimony is (we believe) the first to feature all four
in a single language.
