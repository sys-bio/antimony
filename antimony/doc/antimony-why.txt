/** @page antimony-why Unique features of the Antimony language

Antimony is designed to be:

- <b>Human-readable</b>.  It should be possible to look at an Antimony model and understand what's going on.
- <b>Human-writable</b>.  It should be possible to conceive of a model and create an Antimony model by hand.
- <b>Modular</b>.  Different Antimony models should be able to be combined to create more complex models that are easier to understand due to their compartmentalized nature.
- <b>Accessible to genetic networks</b>.  A special syntax was developed specifically for the design of genetic networks, in keeping with the principles above--these networks should also be understandable, modular, and easily combined.
