<h2>A human-readable, human-writable, model definition language</h2>
<h2>Technical Specifications Document</h2>
</center>

<p>
Note:  Grammar lines are defined with "&lt;&gt;", "[]", and "|" symbols that are not part of the actual grammar, but indicate different options are permitted.  Words in "&lt;&gt;" (i.e. "&lt;symbol name&gt;") indicate a spot that must be filled in with text that matches that description (all such descriptions are defined at the end of the document).  Grammar in "[]" (i.e. "[in &lt;compartment&gt;]" is optional.  The "|" symbol should be read as an 'or' statement, and indicate that two or more possibilities are valid in that spot (i.e. "[const|var]".
</P>
<H3>General Specifications</H3>

<P><B>Order</B></P>
Each statement in Antimony is parsed as a rule that helps define a model.  Any rule that does not contradict a different rule may be presented in any order without affecting the final model.  If two rules contradict one another, the final rule takes precedence, and the parts of the initial rule that contradict the later rule are discarded.  As an example, if earlier in a model we find the rule "<TT>x=5</TT>" and later find the rule "<TT>x=6</TT>", the "<TT>x=5</TT>" rule is discarded in favor of the later rule.  Incompatible rules, such as using the same symbol as a species and as the name of a reaction, are illegal.

</P><P>
The one type of symbol that must be defined before being used is that of a submodule.  The submodule's definition must have come earlier in the Antimony file than its use as a submodule, and the name used for a submodule must not be used in any capacity before being defined.  This goes for subvariable names, too:  '<TT>A.y</TT>' is an illegal symbol to use before '<TT>A</TT>' is defined.

</P><P>
Similarly, once a module has been defined, its components may not be expanded:  if submodule '<TT>A</TT>' did not declare a symbol '<TT>y</TT>', use of the symbol '<TT>A.y</TT>' is illegal, and does not create a new variable inside the submodule.

<p><B>Line endings and white space:</B></P>

</P><P>
Since Antimony is intended to be easy and simple, it is not a requirement to end every line with a '<TT>;</TT>'.  However, this means that a carriage return is syntactically significant, and breaking up a single statement with returns will not work.  If you want to break up your lines anyway, you may use a '<TT>\</TT>' followed by a return, and Antimony will continue as if that line and the line following were all on one line.  This is the only whitespace that Antimony recognizes--all other whitespace is ignored (spaces and tabs) except to distinguish one symbol from another.

	<dd>If a DNA strand is prepended by a '--', Antimony considers it to be 'upstream open'.  If it is suffixed by a '--', it is considered to be 'downstream open'.  The only difference to the parser is that if a &lt;<tt><A HREF="#module">module</a></tt>&gt; contains exactly one DNA strand that is 'upstream open', that module's name may be used in the definition of a DNA strand where it is downstream of another element.  In this case, that DNA strand is place in the containing strand.  If a module contains exactly one DNA strand that is 'downstream open', that module's name may be used in the definition of a DNA strand where it is upstream of another element.  Again, that DNA strand is used in the module's place in the containing strand.  If a module appears in a single DNA strand with both upstream and downstream elements, that module must contain exactly one DNA strand which is both upstream and downstream 'open', and no other DNA strands which are either upstream or downstream 'open'.

<dt>&lt;<tt><b><A name="event definitions">event definitions</a></b></tt>&gt;
	<dd>Defines an event (value changes when a condition is met).
<dt><TT>[&lt;<tt><A href="#symbol">symbol</a></tt>&gt; : ] at|@ &lt;<tt><A href="#boolean expression">boolean expression</a></tt>&gt; : [&lt;<tt><A href="#return">return</a></tt>&gt;] &lt;<tt><A href="#symbol">symbol</a></tt>&gt; = &lt;<tt><A href="#equation">equation</a></tt>&gt; [: [&lt;<tt><A href="#return">return</a></tt>&gt;] &lt;<tt><A href="#symbol">symbol</a></tt>&gt; = &lt;<tt><A href="#equation">equation</a></tt>&gt; ]...</tt>
	<dd>If the first '&lt;<tt><A href="#symbol">symbol</a></tt>&gt;' is used, it will be used as the name of the new event.  (This symbol must not have been used previously in any context.)  If not, its name will be "_E&lt;#&gt;", where &lt;#&gt; is the lowest possible integer </a></tt>&gt;=0 for which no previous symbol of that form exists.
</P><P>
	<dd>After the &lt;<tt><A href="#boolean expression">boolean expression</a></tt>&gt; (see below) is a list of assignments that are to happen when the event condition holds true for the first time.  The equation is to be assigned to the symbol, which must not be const.  (If the symbol was previously undefined for constness, it will now be defined to be variable.)

<dt>&lt;<tt><b><A name="boolean expression">boolean expression</a></b></tt>&gt;
	<dd>An &lt;<tt><A href="#equation">equation</a></tt>&gt; which returns a 'true' or 'false'.  Expressions are judged whether they are boolean based on libSBML's parser.

<dt>&lt;<tt><b><A name="synchronizations">synchronizations</a></b></tt>&gt;
	<dd>Particularly useful to 'connect' submodules, a synchronization claims that two elements are actually the same thing:
<dt><TT>&lt;<tt><A href="#symbol">symbol</a></tt>&gt; is &lt;<tt><A href="#symbol">symbol</a></tt>&gt;</tt>
	<dd>The two symbols are defined to be actually the same thing, with the second symbol taking precedence.  In the final output for this module, only the second symbol will appear.  Any characteristic of the first symbol for which that characteristic of the second symbol is undefined or less specific, the second symbol now embodies.  For example, if the first symbol is a reaction, and the second symbol is a formula, after this synchronization, the symbol will now be defined as a reaction.   If both symbols are defined by conflicting characteristics, the second symbol will take precedence.  In our previous  example, if the first symbol is a reaction with a defined reaction rate, and the second symbol is a formula with a different rate equation, the rate of the resulting reaction will be the second symbol's original rate.
