//Warnings from automatic translation:
//    Unable to use the formula "delta_PL" to set the rate rule for PL:  The variable 'PL' is associated with an assignment rule, and may not additionally have a rate rule.
//    The units of "po" ('mmHg') do not have 'seconds' as their base unit, so assuming this CellML model is trying to take the derivative of something with respect to some not-time element, we are not translating this derivative.
