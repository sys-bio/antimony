  // Compartments and Species:
  compartment cell;
  species I in cell, E in cell, A in cell;

  // Assignment Rules:
  T := (A + 3 * E - (6 * A * E - 3 * E^2 + A^2)^0.5) / 6;
  M := (7 * A - 3 * E - (6 * A * E - 3 * E^2 + A^2)^0.5) / 6;

  // Reactions:
  U1:  => I; cell * P * J;
  U2: 3I + E => ; cell * W2 * I * T;
