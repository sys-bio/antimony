  // Compartments and Species:
  compartment extracellular, endosome, neuroplasm;
  species $BoNT in extracellular, bulk in extracellular, free in extracellular;
  species bound in extracellular, translocate in endosome, lytic in neuroplasm;

  // Assignment Rules:
  BoNT := bulk + free;
  tension := 1 - lytic;

  // Reactions:
  endocytosis: bound => translocate; endocytosis_kT * bound * extracellular;
  translocation: translocate => lytic; translocation_kL * translocate * endosome;
  binding: free => bound; binding_kB * free * extracellular;
  bulk_movement: bulk => free; bulk_movement_kS * bulk * extracellular;

  // Species initializations:
