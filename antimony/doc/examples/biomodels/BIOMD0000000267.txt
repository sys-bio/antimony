  // Compartments and Species:
  compartment extracellular, endosome, neuroplasm;
  species free in extracellular, bound in extracellular, translocate in endosome;
  species lytic in neuroplasm;

  // Assignment Rules:
  tension := 1 - lytic;

  // Reactions:
  endocytosis: bound => translocate; endocytosis_kT*bound*extracellular;
  translocation: translocate => lytic; translocation_kL*translocate*endosome;
  binding: free => bound; binding_kB*free*extracellular;

  // Species initializations:
  free = 1;
  bound = 0;
  translocate = 0;
  lytic = 0;

  // Compartment initializations:
  extracellular = 1;
  endosome = 1;
  neuroplasm = 1;

  // Variable initializations:
  endocytosis_kT = 0.141;
  endocytosis_kT has pmin;
  translocation_kL = 0.013;
