  // Compartments and Species:
  compartment cytoplasm, ER, extracellular;
  species x in ER, y in cytoplasm;

  // Assignment Rules:
  fy := y^n/(a^n + y^n);

  // Reactions:
  reaction_0000001:  => y; gamma*cytoplasm;
  reaction_0000002: x -> y; k*x*cytoplasm - k1*y*ER;
  reaction_0000003: y => ; beta*y*extracellular;

  // Species initializations:
  x = 1;
  y = 1;

  // Compartment initializations:
  cytoplasm = 1;
  ER = 1;
  extracellular = 1;

  // Variable initializations:
  k = 0.01;
