/** @mainpage Antimony and libAntimony documentation

<P>Thank you for using the Antimony model definition language.  From here, you can learn how to create and use Antimony-formatted files.</P>

- @subpage antimony-why A brief rundown of some of the unique features of Antimony
- The <A class="el" HREF="Tutorial.pdf">Tutorial</a> will walk you through creating Antimony files from scratch.
- The @subpage antimony-technical-spec is a reference manual, explicitly describing how to parse Antimony models.
- @subpage antimony-installation for installing and compiling libAntimony.
- The <A class="el" HREF="antimony__api_8h.html">available API commands</a> when incorporating libAntimony into your own projects.
- For full functionality, libAntimony makes use of <A HREF="http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML">libSBML</a> to convert models to and from the SBML format.  

<P>libAntimony is hosted on sourceforge.net, and the following downloadable packages are available from there:</P>

- The <A HREF="SOURCE">source code</a> (with build packages for Windows, Unix, and MacOS).  (You will also need <A HREF="http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML">libSBML</a> for full functionality.)
- Windows <A HREF="BINARIES">binaries</a>, including the libAntimony dll, and two executables to convert SBML files to Antimony, and visa-versa.
- This <A HREF="DOCUMENTATION">documentation</a>.

<p>If you have any issues with Antimony, whether bugs in the code or inadequacies of the documentation, please report them using the bug-tracking feature of sourceforge.net:  http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=251883&atid=1126927 (requires logging in).</P>
