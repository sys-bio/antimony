/** @page antimony-qt QTAntimony

QTAntimony is a cross-platform GUI text editor which will translate Antimony models to SBML and visa-versa.  To compile, you will need QT--the project file QTAntimony.pro is provided in the QTAntimony subdirectory of the source code.  We also have provided an executable for <A target="_top" HREF="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/antimony/QTAntimony_v0.5_Win.zip">Windows</a>.  Since this program is still in development, we have not provided executables for MacOS or linux, but if you contact us, we can send you the latest and greatest for your system, or help you get QT up and running on your system so you can compile it yourself.

QTAntimony has been successfully compiled for Windows:
