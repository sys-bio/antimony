QTAntimony is a cross-platform GUI text editor which will translate Antimony models to SBML and visa-versa.  To compile, you will need QT--the project file QTAntimony.pro is provided in the QTAntimony subdirectory of the <A class="el" target="_top" HREF="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/antimony/antimony_src_v1.3.tar.gz">source code</a>.  We also have provided a <A target="_top" HREF="https://sourceforge.net/projects/antimony/files/Windows%20binaries/1.3.0/antimonyInstaller_v1.3.exe/download">Windows installer</a> and a <A class="el" target="_top" HREF="https://sourceforge.net/projects/antimony/files/Mac%20binaries/1.3.0/QTAntimony_v1.3.dmg/download">Mac DMG</a>.  Given the variety of linux systems out there, we have not provided a binary distribution for that, but we are willing to provide whatever support you might need to get it up and running on your system.
