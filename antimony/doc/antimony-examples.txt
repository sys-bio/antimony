/** @page antimony-examples Example Antimony Models

- <A HREF="examples/ex_antimony_input.txt">ex_antimony_input.txt</a> is an example input file that defines several modules each defining a genetic network, a single model that attaches them together, and an implementation of that model that tests it with real input.  If you convert the file to SBML, you get several SBML files, one for each module:  (Note:  depending on your browser, the following .xml files may not display correctly.  If not, either right-click and download them to a file, or select 'View Source'.)
  - A <A target="_top" HREF="examples/ex_sbml_output_bistable_sbml.xml">bistable switch</a>
  - A <A target="_top" HREF="examples/ex_sbml_output_ffn_sbml.xml">feed-forward network</a>
  - A <A target="_top" HREF="examples/ex_sbml_output_ringoscil_sbml.xml">ring oscillator</a>
  - The <A target="_top" HREF="examples/ex_sbml_output_combined_model_sbml.xml">combined model</a>, and finally
  - The <A target="_top" HREF="examples/ex_sbml_output___main_sbml.xml">main module</a> that implements the combined model.

- Conversely, an SBML <A target="_top" HREF="examples/ex_sbml_input.xml">oscillator</a> was converted to Antimony using the sbml2antimony converter, producing <A HREF="examples/ex_antimony_output.txt">this model</a>.

- Finally, we have the 211 current (as of 5/2009) @subpage antimony-biomodels.  The original models can be found at <A target="_top" HREF="http://biomodels.net">BioModels.net</a>  When these Antimony models were converted back to SBML, only two of them (models 7 and 183) produced significantly different simulation results when simulated for 10 seconds using the roadRunner simulator.  Model 7 was different because Antimony has no syntax for delayed events, and Model 183 had small numerical differences for a single parameter at about 1.5 seconds (that self-corrected thereafter).
