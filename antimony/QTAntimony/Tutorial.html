<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 2; orphans: 2"><B>Introduction</B></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 2; orphans: 2">Since
the advent of SBML (the Systems Biology Markup Language) computer
models of biological systems have been able to be transferred easily
between different labs and different computer programs without loss
of specificity.  But SBML was not designed to be readable or writable
by humans, only by computer programs, so other programs have sprung
up to allow users to more easily create the models they need.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 2; orphans: 2">Many
of these programs are GUI-based, and allow drag-and-drop editing of
species and reactions, such as JDesigner and TinkerCell.  A few, like
Jarnac, take a text-based approach, and allow the creation of models
in a text editor.  This has the advantage of being faster, more
readily cross-platform, and readable by others without translation. 
Antimony (named this because the chemical symbol of the element is
'Sb') was designed as a successor to Jarnac's model definition
language, with some new features that mesh with newer elements of
SBML, some new features we feel will be generally applicable, and
some new features that we hope will facilitate the creation of
genetic networks in particular.  A programming library 'libAntimony'
was developed in tandem with the language to allow computer
translation of Antimony-formatted models into SBML and other formats
used by other computer programs.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 2; orphans: 2">The
basic features of Antimony include the ability to:</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 2; orphans: 2">  -
Simply define species and reactions,</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 2; orphans: 2">  -
Package and re-use models as modules with defined or implied
interfaces,</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 2; orphans: 2">  -
Define events and compartments, and 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 2; orphans: 2">  -
Create 'DNA strands' whose elements can pass reaction rates to
downstream elements, and inherit and modify reaction rates from
upstream elements.</P>


<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 2; orphans: 2; page-break-before: always">
<FONT SIZE=4><B>Language Specifications</B></FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 2; orphans: 2"><B>Species
and Reactions</B></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
The simplest Antimony file may simply have a list of reactions
containing species, along with some initializations.  Reactions are
written as two lists of species, separated by a '-&gt;', and followed
by a semicolon:</P>

<P CLASS="courier-text-western" STYLE="widows: 2; orphans: 2">  S1 +
E -&gt; ES;</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
Optionally, you may provide a reaction rate for the reaction by
including a mathematical expression after the semicolon, followed by
another semicolon:</P>

<P CLASS="courier-text-western" STYLE="widows: 2; orphans: 2">  S1 +
E -&gt; ES; k1*k2*S1*E - k2*ES;</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
You may also give the reaction a name by prepending the name followed
by a colon:</P>

<P CLASS="courier-text-western" STYLE="widows: 2; orphans: 2">  J0:
S1 + E -&gt; ES; k1*k2*S1*E - k2*ES;</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
The same effect can be achieved by setting the reaction rate
separately, by assigning the reaction rate to the reaction name with
an '=':</P>

<P CLASS="courier-text-western" STYLE="widows: 2; orphans: 2">  J0:
S1 + E -&gt; ES;<br/>  J0 =
k1*k2*S1*E - k2*ES;</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
You may even define them in the opposite order--they are all ways of
saying the same thing.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
At this point, Antimony will make several assumptions about your
model.  It will assume (and require) that all symbols that appear in
the reaction itself are species.  Any symbol that appears elsewhere
that is not used or defined as a species is 'undefined'; 'undefined'
symbols may later be declared or used as species or as 'formulas',
Antimony's term for constants and packaged equations like SBML's
assignment rules.  In the above example, k1 and k2 are (thus far)
undefined symbols, which may be assigned straightforwardly:</P>

<P CLASS="courier-text-western" STYLE="widows: 2; orphans: 2">  J0:
S1 + E -&gt; ES; k1*k2*S1*E - k2*ES;</br>  k1 =
3;</br>  k2 =
1.4;</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
More complicated expressions are also allowed, as are the creation of
symbols which exist only to simplify or clarify other expressions:</P>

<P CLASS="courier-text-western" STYLE="widows: 2; orphans: 2">  pH =
7;<br/>  k3 =
-log10(pH);</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
The initial concentrations of species are defined in exactly the same
way as formulas, and may be just as complex (or simple):</P>

<P CLASS="courier-text-western" STYLE="widows: 2; orphans: 2">  S1 =
2;<br/>  E =
3;<br/>  ES =
S1 + E;</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
Order for any of the above (and in general in Antimony) does not
matter at all:  you may use a symbol before defining it, or define it
before using it.  As long as you do not use the same symbol in an
incompatible context (such as using the same name as a reaction and a
species), your resulting model will still be valid.  Antimony files
written by libAntimony will adhere to a standard format of defining
symbols, but again, this is not required.</P>


<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 2; orphans: 2"><B>Constant
and variable symbols</B></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
Some models have 'boundary species' in their reactions, or species
whose concentrations do not change as a result of participating in a
reaction.  To declare that a species is a boundary species, use the
'const' keyword:</P>

<P CLASS="courier-text-western" STYLE="widows: 2; orphans: 2">  const
S1;</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
While you're declaring it, you may want to be more specific by using
the 'species' keyword:</P>

<P CLASS="courier-text-western" STYLE="widows: 2; orphans: 2">  const
species S1;</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
If a symbol appears as a participant in a reaction, antimony will
recognize that it is a species automatically, so the use of the
keyword 'species' is not required.  If, however, you have a species
which never appears in a reaction, you will need to use the 'species'
keyword.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
If you have several species that are all constant, you may declare
this all in one line:</P>

<P CLASS="courier-text-western" STYLE="widows: 2; orphans: 2">  const
species S1, S2, S3;</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
While species are variable by default, you may also declare them so
explicitly with the 'var' keyword:</P>

<P CLASS="courier-text-western" STYLE="widows: 2; orphans: 2">  var
species S4, S5, S6;</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
Likewise, formulas are constant by default.  They may be initialized
with an equals sign, with either a simple or a complex formula:</P>

<P CLASS="courier-text-western" STYLE="widows: 2; orphans: 2">  k1 =
5;<br/>  k2 =
2*S1;</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
You may also explicitly declare whether they are constant or
variable:</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
 
</P>
<P CLASS="courier-text-western" STYLE="widows: 2; orphans: 2">  const
k1;<br/>  var
k2;</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
and be more specific and declare that both are formulas:</P>

<P CLASS="courier-text-western" STYLE="widows: 2; orphans: 2">  const
formula k1;<br/>  var
formula k2;</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
Variables defined with an equals sign are assigned those values at
the start of the simulation.  In SBML terms, they use the 'Initial
Assignment' values.  If the formula is to vary during the course of
the simulation, use the Assignment Rule (or Rate Rule) syntax,
described later.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
You can also mix-and-match your declarations however best suits what
you want to convey:</P>

<P CLASS="courier-text-western" STYLE="widows: 2; orphans: 2"> 
species S1, S2, S3, S4;<br/> 
formula k1, k2, k3, k4;<br/><BR>
<br/>  const
S1, S4, k1, k3;<br/>  var
S2, S3, k2, k4;</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
Antimony is a pure model definition language, meaning that all
statements in the language serve to build a static model of a dynamic
biological system.  Unlike Jarnac, sequential programming techniques
such as re-using a variable for a new purpose will not work:</P>

<P CLASS="courier-text-western" STYLE="widows: 2; orphans: 2">  pH =
7;<br/>  k1 =
-log10(pH);<br/>  pH =
8.2;<br/>  k2 =
-log10(pH);</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
In a sequential programming language, the above would result in
different values being stored in k1 and k2.  (This is how Jarnac
works, for those familiar with that language/simulation environment.)
 In a pure model definition language like Antimony, 'pH', 'k1', and
'k2' are static symbols that are being defined by Antimony
statements, and not processed in any way.  A simulator that requests
the mathematical expression for k1 will receive the string
"-log10(pH)"; the same string it will receive for k2.  A request
for the mathematical expression for pH will receive the string "8.2",
since that's the last definition found in the file.  As such, k1 and
k2 will end up being identical.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
As a side note, we considered having libAntimony store a warning when
presented with an input file such as the example above with a later
definition overwriting an earlier definition.  However, there was no
way with our current interface to let the user know that a warning
had been saved, and it seemed like there could be a number of cases
where the user might legitimately want to override an earlier
definition (such as when using submodules, as we'll get to in a bit).
 So for now, the above is valid Antimony input that just so happens
to produce exactly the same output as:</P>

<P CLASS="courier-text-western" STYLE="widows: 2; orphans: 2">  pH =
8.2;<br/>  k1 =
-log10(pH);<br/>  k2 =
-log10(pH);</P>


<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 2; orphans: 2"><B>Modules</B></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
Antimony input files may define several different models, and may use
previously-defined models as parts of newly-defined models.  Each
different model is known as a 'module', and is minimally defined by
putting the keyword 'model' (or 'module', if you like) and the name
you want to give the module at the beginning of the model definitions
you wish to encapsulate, and putting the keyword 'end' at the end:</P>

<P CLASS="courier-text-western" STYLE="widows: 2; orphans: 2">model
example<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;S + E
-&gt; ES;<br/>end</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
After this module is defined, it can be used as a part of another
model (this is the one time that order matters in Antimony).  To
import a module into another module, simply use the name of the
module, followed by parentheses and a semicolon:</P>


<P CLASS="courier-text-western" STYLE="widows: 2; orphans: 2">model
example<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;S + E
-&gt; ES;<br/>end<br/>
<br/>model
example2<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
example();<br/>end</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
This is usually not very helpful in and of itself-you'll likely
want to give the submodule a name so you can refer to the things
inside it.  To do this, pre-pend a name followed by a colon:</P>

<P CLASS="courier-text-western" STYLE="widows: 2; orphans: 2">model
example2<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;A:
example();<br/>end<br/>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
Now, you can modify or define elements in the submodule by referring
to symbols in the submodule by name, pre-pended with the name you've
given the module, followed by a '.':</P>

<P CLASS="courier-text-western" STYLE="widows: 2; orphans: 2">model
example2<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;A:
example();<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;A.S =
3;<br/>end</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
This results in a model with a single reaction (<FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace">A.S
+ A.E -&gt; A.ES</FONT>) and a single initial condition (<FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace">A.S
= 3</FONT>).</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
You may also import multiple copies of modules, and modules that
themselves contain submodules:</P>

<P CLASS="courier-text-western" STYLE="widows: 2; orphans: 2">model
example3<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;A:
example();<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;B:
example();<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;C:
example2();<br/>end</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
This would result in a model with three reactions and a single
initial condition.</P>

<P CLASS="courier-text-western" STYLE="widows: 2; orphans: 2">&nbsp;&nbsp;A.S +
A.E -&gt; A.ES<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;B.S +
B.E -&gt; B.ES<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;C.A.S
+ C.A.E -&gt; C.A.ES<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;C.A.S
= 3;</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
You can also use the species defined in submodules in new reactions:</P>

<P CLASS="courier-text-western" STYLE="widows: 2; orphans: 2">model
example4<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;A:
example();<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;A.S
-&gt; ; kdeg*A.S;<br/>end</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
When combining multiple submodules, you can also 'attach' them to
each other by declaring that a species in one submodule is the same
species as is found in a different submodule by using the 'is'
keyword ("A.S is B.S").  For example, let's say that we have a
species which is known to bind reversibly to two different species. 
You could set this up as the following:</P>

<P CLASS="courier-text-western" STYLE="widows: 2; orphans: 2">model
side_reaction<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;J0: S
+ E -&gt; SE; k1*k2*S*E - k2*ES;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;S =
5;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;E =
3;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;SE =
E+S;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;k1 =
1.2;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;k2 =
0.4;<br/>end<br/><BR>
<br/>model
full_reaction<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;A:
side_reaction();<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;B:
side_reaction()<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;A.S
is B.S;<br/>end</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
If you wanted, you could give the identical species a new name to
more easily use it in the 'full_reaction' module:</P>

<P CLASS="courier-text-western" STYLE="widows: 2; orphans: 2">model
full_reaction<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;var
species S;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;A:
side_reaction();<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;B:
side_reaction()<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;A.S
is S;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;B.S
is S;<br/>end</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
In this system, 'S' is involved in two reversible reactions with
exactly the same reaction kinetics and initial concentrations.  Let's
now say the reaction rate of the second side-reaction takes the same
form, but that the kinetics are twice as fast, and the starting
conditions are different:</P>

<P CLASS="courier-text-western" STYLE="widows: 2; orphans: 2">model
full_reaction<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;var
species S;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;A:
side_reaction();<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;A.S
is S;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;B:
side_reaction()<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;B.S
is S;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;B.k1
= 2.4;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;B.k2
= 0.8;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;B.E =
10;<br/>end</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
Note that since we defined the initial concentration of 'SE' as 'S +
E', B.SE will now have a different initial concentration, since B.E
has been changed.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
Finally, we add a third side reaction, one in which S binds
irreversibly, and where the complex it forms degrades.  We'll need a
new reaction rate, and a whole new reaction as well:</P>

<P CLASS="courier-text-western" STYLE="widows: 2; orphans: 2">model
full_reaction<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;var
species S;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;A:
side_reaction();<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;A.S
is S;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;B:
side_reaction()<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;B.S
is S;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;B.k1
= 2.4;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;B.k2
= 0.8;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;B.E =
10;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;C:
side_reaction();<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;C.S
is S;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;C.J0
=  C.k1*C.k2*S*C.E<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;J3:
C.SE -&gt; ; C.SE*k3;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;k3 =
0.02;<br/>end</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
Note that defining the reaction rate of C.J0 used the symbol 'S;
exactly the same result would be obtained if we had used 'C.S' or
even 'A.S' or 'B.S'.  Antimony knows that those symbols all refer to
the same species, and will give them all the same name in subsequent
output.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
For convenience and style, modules may define an interface where some
symbols in the module are more easily renamed.  To do this, first
enclose a list of the symbols to export in parentheses after the name
of the model when defining it:</P>

<P CLASS="courier-text-western" STYLE="widows: 2; orphans: 2">model
side_reaction(S, k1)<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;J0: S
+ E -&gt; SE; k1*k2*S*E - k2*ES;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;S =
5;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;E =
3;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;SE =
E+S;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;k1 =
1.2;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;k2 =
0.4;<br/>end</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
Then when you use that module as a submodule, you can provide a list
of new symbols in parentheses:</P>

<P CLASS="courier-text-western" STYLE="widows: 2; orphans: 2">  A:
side_reaction(spec2, k2);</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
is equivalent to writing:</P>

<P CLASS="courier-text-western" STYLE="widows: 2; orphans: 2">  A:
side_reaction();<br/>A.S
is spec2;<br/>A.k1
is k2;</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
One thing to be aware of when using this method:  Since wrapping
definitions in a defined model is optional, all 'bare' declarations
are defined to be in a default module with the name '__main'.  If
there are no unwrapped definitions, '__main' will still exist, but
will be empty.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
As a final note:  use of the 'is' keyword is not restricted to
elements inside submodules.  As a result, if you wish to change the
name of an element (if, for example, you want the reactions to look
simpler in Antimony, but wish to have a more descriptive name in the
exported SBML), you may use 'is' as well:</P>

<P CLASS="courier-text-western" STYLE="widows: 2; orphans: 2">   A -&gt; B;<br>
  A is ABA;<br>
  B is ABA8OH;</p>
<P CLASS="courier-text-western" STYLE="font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
is equivalent to writing:</P>

<P CLASS="courier-text-western" STYLE="widows: 2; orphans: 2"> ABA -&gt; ABA8OH;</p>
<P CLASS="courier-text-western" STYLE="font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
<BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 2; orphans: 2"><B>Display
Names</B></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
 When some tools visualize models, they make a distinction between
the 'id' of an element, which must be unique to the model and which
must conform to certain naming conventions, and the 'name' of an
element, which does not have to be unique and which has much less
stringent naming requirements.  In Antimony, it is the id of elements
which is used everywhere.  However, you may also set the 'display
name' of an element by using the 'is' keyword and putting the name in
quotes:</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
More than one file may be used to define a set of modules in Antimony
through the use of the 'import' keyword.  At any point in the file
outside of a module definition, use the word 'import' followed by the
name of the file in quotation marks, and Antimony will include the
modules defined in that file as if they had been cut and pasted into
your file at that point.  SBML files may also be included in this
way:</P>

<P CLASS="courier-text-western" STYLE="widows: 2; orphans: 2">import
"models1.txt"<br/>import
"oscli.xml"<br/>
<br/>model
mod2()<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;A:
mod1();<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;B:
oscli();<br/>end</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
In this example, the file 'models1.txt' is an Antimony file that
defines the module 'mod1', and the file 'oscli.xml' is an SBML file
that defines a model named 'oscli'.  The Antimony module 'mod2' may
then use modules from either or both of the other imported files.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
Remember that imported files act like they were cut and pasted into
the main file.  As such, any bare declarations in the main file and
in the imported files will all contribute to the default '__main'
module Most SBML files will not contribute to this module, unless the
name of the model in the file is '__main' (for example, if it was
created by the antimony converter).</P>



<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 2; orphans: 2"><B>Compartments</B></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
A compartment is a demarcated region of space that contains species
and has a particular volume.  In Antimony, you may ignore
compartments altogether, and all species are assumed to be members of
a default compartment with the imaginative name 'default_compartment'
with a constant volume of 1.  You may define other compartments by
using the 'compartment' keyword:</P>

<P CLASS="courier-text-western" STYLE="widows: 2; orphans: 2"> 
compartment comp1;</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
Compartments may also be variable or constant, and defined as such
with 'var' and 'const':</P>

<P CLASS="courier-text-western" STYLE="widows: 2; orphans: 2">  const
compartment comp1;<br/>  var
compartment comp2;</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
The volume of a compartment may be set with an '=' in the same manner
as species and reaction rates:</P>

<P CLASS="courier-text-western" STYLE="widows: 2; orphans: 2">  comp1
= 5;<br/>  comp2
= 3*S1;</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
To declare that something is in a compartment, the 'in' keyword is
used, either during declaration:</P>

<P CLASS="courier-text-western" STYLE="widows: 2; orphans: 2"> 
compartment comp1 in comp2;<br/>  const
species S1 in comp2;<br/>  S2 in
comp2;</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">

	If not, if the symbol is in a DNA strand (see the next section)
	which has been declared to be in a compartment, it is in that

	declared DNA strand that has a declared compartment in the model.</P>
	<LI><P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
	If not, if the symbol is a member of a reaction with a declared

</UL>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
(you may also claim an event is 'in' a compartment just like
everything else ('E1 in comp1:').  This declaration will never change
the compartment of anything else.)</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
Note:  it is a good idea to enclose inequalities (&lt;, &gt;, &lt;=,
&gt;=, ==, and !=), and logic (&amp;&amp;, ||, and !) in parentheses
when using them here.  The parser that translates these statements to
SBML is not very robust and can get confused translating these
symbols when not enclosed in parentheses.  This will be fixed in
later versions of libAntimony.</P>


<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 2; orphans: 2"><B>Assignment
Rules:</B></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
In some models, species and/or variables change in a manner not
described by a reaction.  When a variable receives a new value at
every point in the model, this can be expressed in an assignment
rule, which in Antimony is formulated with a ':=' as:</P>

<P CLASS="courier-text-western" STYLE="widows: 2; orphans: 2">
   Ptot := P1 + P2 + PE;</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
In this example, 'Ptot' will continually be updated to reflect the
total amount of 'P' present in the model.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
Each symbol (species or formula) may have only one assignment rule
associated with it.  If an Antimony file defines more than one rule,
only the last will be saved.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
When species are used as the target of an assignment rule, they are
defined to be 'boundary species' and thus 'const'.  Antimony doesn't
have a separate syntax for boundary species whose concentrations
never change vs. boundary species whose concentrations change due to
assignment rules (or rate rules, below).  SBML distinguishes between
boundary species that may change and boundary species that may not,
but in Antimony, all boundary species may change as the result of
being in an Assignment Rule or Rate Rule.</P>


<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 2; orphans: 2"><B>Rate
Rules:</B></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
Rate rules define the change in a symbol's value over time instead of
defining its new value.  In this sense, they are similar to reaction
rate kinetics, but without an explicit stoichiometry of change. 
These may be modeled in Antimony by appending an apostrophe to the
name of the symbol, and using an equals sign to define the rate:</P>

<P CLASS="courier-text-western" STYLE="widows: 2; orphans: 2">S1'
= </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal"> V1*(1 - S1)/(K1 + (1 -
S1)) - V2*S1/(K2 + S1) </SPAN>
</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
Note that unlike initializations and assignment rules, formulas in
rate rules may be self-referential, either directly or indirectly.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
Any symbol may have only one rate rule or assignment rule associated
with it.  Should it find more than one, only the last will be saved.</P>


<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 2; orphans: 2"><B>DNA
Strands:</B></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
A new concept in Antimony that has not been modeled explicitly in
previous model definition languages such as SBML is the idea of
having DNA strands where downstream elements can inherit reaction
rates from upstream elements.  DNA strands are declared by connecting
symbols with '--':</P>

<P CLASS="courier-text-western" STYLE="widows: 2; orphans: 2"> 
--P1--G1--stop--P2--G2--</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
You can also give the strand a name:</P>

<P CLASS="courier-text-western" STYLE="widows: 2; orphans: 2">  dna1:
--P1--G1--</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
By default, the reaction rate or formula associated with an element
of a DNA strand is equal to the reaction rate or formula of the
element upstream of it in the strand.  Thus, if P1 is a promoter and
G1 is a gene, in the model:</P>

<P CLASS="courier-text-western" STYLE="widows: 2; orphans: 2">  dna1:
--P1--G1--<br/>  P1 =
S1*k;<br/>  G1:
-&gt; prot1;</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
the reaction rate of G1 will be "S1*k".</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
It is also possible to modulate the inherited reaction rate.  To do
this, we use ellipses ('...') as shorthand for 'the formula for the
element upstream of me'.  Let's add a ribosome binding site that
increases the rate of production of protein by a factor of three, and
say that the promoter actually increases the rate of protein
production by S1*k instead of setting it to S1*k:</P>

<P CLASS="courier-text-western" STYLE="widows: 2; orphans: 2">  dna1:
--P1--RBS1--G1--<br/>  P1 =
S1*k + ...;<br/>  RBS1
= ...*3;<br/>  G1:
-&gt; prot1;</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 2; orphans: 2"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">Since
in this model, nothing is upstream of P1, the upstream rate is set to
zero, so the final reaction rate </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">of
G1 is equal to "(S1*k + 0)*3".  </SPAN>
</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
Valid elements of DNA strands include formulas (operators), reactions
(genes), and other DNA strands.  Let's wrap our model so far in a
submodule, and then use the strand in a new strand:</P>

<P CLASS="courier-text-western" STYLE="widows: 2; orphans: 2">model
strand1()<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;dna1:
--P1--RBS1--G1--<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;P1 =
S1*k + ...;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;RBS1
= ...*3;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;G1:
-&gt; prot1;<br/>end<br/><BR>
<br/>model
fullstrand()<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;A:
strand1();<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;fulldna:  P2--A.dna1<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;P2 =
S2*k2;<br/>end</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
In the model 'fullstrand', the reaction that produces A.prot1 is
equal to "((A.S1*A.k+(S2*k2))*3)".</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
Operators and genes may be duplicated and appear in multiple strands:</P>

<P CLASS="courier-text-western" STYLE="widows: 2; orphans: 2">  dna1:
 --P1--RBS1--G1--<br/>  dna2:
 P2--dna1<br/>  dna3:
 P2--RBS2--G1</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
Strands, however, count as unique constructs, and may only appear as
singletons or within a single other strand (and may not, of course,
exist in a loop, being contained in a strand that it itself
contains).</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
If the reaction rate or formula for any duplicated symbol is left at
the default or if it contains ellipses explicitly ('...'), it will be
equal to the sum of all reaction rates in all the strands in which it
appears.  If we further define our above model:</P>

<P CLASS="courier-text-western" STYLE="widows: 2; orphans: 2">  dna1:
 --P1--RBS1--G1--<br/>  dna2:
 P2--dna1<br/>  dna3:
 P2--RBS2--G1<br/>  P1 =
...+0.3;<br/>  P2 =
...+1.2;<br/>  RBS1
= ...*0.8;<br/>  RBS2
= ...*1.1;<br/>  G1:
-&gt; prot1;</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
The reaction rate for the production of 'prot1' will be equal to
"(((0+1.2)+0.3)*0.8) + (((0+1.2)*1.1))".</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
If you set the reaction rate of G1 without using an ellipsis, but
include it in multiple strands, its reaction rate will be a multiple
of the number of strands it is a part of.  For example, if you set
the reaction rate of G1 above to "k1*S1", and include it in two
strands, the net reaction rate will be "k1*S1 + k1*S1".</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 2; orphans: 2"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">The
purpose of prepending or postfixing a '--' to a strand is to declare
that the strand in question is designed to have DNA attached to it at
that end.  If exactly one DNA strand is defined with an upstream </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">'--'
in its definition in a submodule, the name of that module may be used

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
Submodule strands intended to be used in the middle of other strands

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 2; orphans: 2"><B>Interactions</B></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
Some species act as activators or repressors of reactions that they
do not actively participate in.  Typical models do not bother
mentioning this explicitly, as it will show up in the reaction rates.
 However, for visualization purposes and/or for cases where the
reaction rates might not be known explicitly, you may declare these
interactions using the same format as reactions, using different
symbols instead of the "-&gt;":  for activations, use "-o";
for inhibitions, use "-|", and for unknown interactions or for
interactions which sometimes activate and sometimes inhibit, use
"-(":</P>


<P CLASS="courier-text-western" STYLE="widows: 2; orphans: 2">  J0:
S1 + E -&gt; SE;<br/>  i1:
S2 -| J0;<br/>  i2:
S3 -o J0;<br/>  i3:
S4 -( J0;</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
If a reaction rate is given for the reaction in question, that
reaction must include the species listed as interacting with that
reaction.  This, then, is legal:</P>

<P CLASS="courier-text-western" STYLE="widows: 2; orphans: 2">  J0:
S1 + E -&gt; SE; k1*S1*E/S2<br/>  i1:
S2 -| J0;</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
because the species S2 is present in the formula "k1*S1*E/S2".
If the concentration of an inhibitory species increases, it should
decrease the reaction rate of the reaction it inhibits, and visa
versa for activating species.  The current version of libAntimony
(v1.0) does not check this, but future versions may add the check.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
When the reaction rate is not known, species from interactions will
be added to the SBML 'listOfModifiers' for the reaction in question. 
Normally, the kinetic law is parsed by libAntimony and any species
there are added to the list of modifiers automatically, but if there
is no kinetic law to parse, this is how to add species to that list.</P>


<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 2; orphans: 2"><B>Function
Definitions</B></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
You may create user-defined functions in a similar fashion to the way
you create modules, and then use these functions in Antimony
equations.  These functions must be basic single equations, and act
in a similar manner to macro expansions.  As an example, you might
define the quadratic equation thus:</P>

<P CLASS="courier-text-western" STYLE="widows: 2; orphans: 2">function
quadratic(x, a, b, c)<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;a*x^2
+ b*x + c<br/>end</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
And then use it in a later equation:</P>

<P CLASS="courier-text-western" STYLE="widows: 2; orphans: 2">  S3 =
quadratic(s1, k1, k2, k3);</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
This would effectively define S3 to have the equation "k1*s1^2 +
k2*s1 + k3".</P>


<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 2; orphans: 2"><B>Importing
and Exporting Antimony Models</B></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
Once you have created an Antimony file, you can convert it to SBML
using the 'antimony2sbml' program available from
<A HREF="http://antimony.sourceforge.net/">http://antimony.sourceforge.net/</A>
 This will convert each of the models defined in the Antimony text
file into a separate SBML file, including the overall '__main' module
(if it contains anything).  These files can then be used for
simulation or visualization in other programs.  This is a
command-line program that takes as its arguments a list of Antimony
files to convert:</P>

<P CLASS="courier-text-western" STYLE="widows: 2; orphans: 2"> 
antimony2sbml.exe model1.txt model2.txt</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
will create one SBML file for each model in the two Antimony files in
the working directory of the executable.  Each file will be of the
fomat "[prefix]_[modelname].xml", where [prefix] is the filename
with '.txt' removed (if present).</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
SBML files can also be converted to the Antimony format using
'sbml2antimony'.  This works similarly to the antimony2sbml program,
in that it takes a list of SBML files and outputs one Antimony file
for each SBML input.  The output file will be the original filename
with '.xml' removed and '.txt' appended:</P>

<P CLASS="courier-text-western" STYLE="widows: 2; orphans: 2"> 
sbml2antimony.exe oscli.xml ffn.xml</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
will output two files in the working directory:  'oscli.txt' and
'ffn.txt'.  
</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
In time, we hope that other programs will be made available to
convert Antimony files to other formats.  The library 'libAntimony'
is available also at <A HREF="http://antimony.sourceforge.net/">http://antimony.sourceforge.net/</A>
for programmers who wish to incorporate the ability to read in
Antimony files to their own programs, and an API is provided to
convert the resulting models to other formats.  Our own lab's
TinkerCell program (<A HREF="http://www.tinkercell.com/">http://www.tinkercell.com/</A>)
can now convert basic Antimony models to its own format, and display
the result visually.</P>

For reference, here are some of the differences you will see when
converting models between SBML and Antimony:</P>
             
<UL>
	<LI><P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
	<B>Local parameters</B> in SBML reactions <B>become global
	parameters</B> in Antimony, with the reaction name pre-pended.  If a
	different symbol already has the new name, a number is appended to
	the variable name so it will be unique.  These do not get converted
	back to local parameters when converting Antimony back to SBML.</P>

	<B>Units</B> in SBML models <B>disappear</B> in Antimony with one
	exception:  If you combining SBML models directly using the 'import'
	functionality, libAntimony will check to make sure you don't try to
	synchronize two symbols (via the 'is' syntax) that have different
	units.  (We hope to add units to a future version of Antimony.)</P>

	function's interface (as the last in the list of symbols), and any
	uses of the function are modified to use 'time' in the call.  In
        other words, a function "function(x, y): x+y*time" becomes
        "function(x, y, time_ref): x + y*time_ref", and formulas that
        use "function(A, B)" become "function(A, B, time)"</P>
